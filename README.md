# Real-time face Recognition Using Facenet On Tensorflow 2.X


Just add the Notebook usable for Face recognition and tested on a Winston Churchill corpus!

Adapted to load an image and test on your own dataset.

Make sure your images are good quality (the face recognition is obviously better).

Usefull for Digital Humanities corpora!
